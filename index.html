                                                            To qualify for the 60,000 bonus miles, you must make eligible purchases with your Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card that total $2,000 or more (the "Threshold Amount") within your first 3 months of Card Membership starting from the date your account is approved. In rare instances, your period to spend $2,000 may be shorter than 3 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 3 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). Eligible purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card account. The bonus miles will be credited to your account 8-12 weeks after you reach the Threshold Amount. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases to meet the Threshold Amount do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers (balance transfers are not available on Delta SkyMiles® Business Credit Cards), cash advances, purchases of traveler's checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person payments, or purchases of any cash equivalents. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for this offer. To receive the 60,000 bonus miles your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment. If we in our sole discretion determine that you have engaged in abuse, misuse, or gaming in connection with the offer in any way or that you intend to do so (for example, if you applied for one or more cards to obtain a welcome offer (s) that we did not intend for you; if you cancel or downgrade your account within 12 months after acquiring it; or if you cancel or return purchases you made to meet the Threshold Amount), we may not credit bonus miles to your account. We may also cancel this Card account and other Card accounts you may have with us. Additional Card Members on your account are not eligible for this offer.</p>

Delta Purchases are eligible purchases where Delta is the merchant of record, such as purchases via delta.com, the Fly Delta app, phone reservations, or ticket counters, such as upgrades, miles, seat selection, Delta Sky Club®  membership, and in-flight purchases of food, alcoholic beverages and audio headsets on Delta-operated flights. Delta Purchases do not include other in-flight purchases where Delta is not the merchant of record, such as in-flight wireless internet access and charitable contributions. Delta Gift Cards do not qualify. Delta Purchases include Delta Vacations® packages but not other all-inclusive packages. Delta Purchases include purchases of qualifying Delta, Delta Connection® carrier and Delta Shuttle®  flights taken with the purchase of a fare that is eligible for SkyMiles mileage credit. Additional miles earned for Delta flight purchases made with the Card will be based on the total ticket price, including base fare, carrier-imposed surcharges and government-imposed taxes and fees.</p>
                                                        <p>Eligible purchases mean purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of travelers checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents. Miles will be posted to your Delta SkyMiles account 8 to 12 weeks after the end of each month. To be eligible to receive miles, your Card account must not be canceled or past due at the time of fulfillment.

A purchase will not qualify for additional miles if the merchant’s code is not eligible. A purchase may not qualify for additional miles if the merchant submits the purchase using a mobile or wireless card reader or if you use a mobile or digital wallet. Additional terms and restrictions may apply.</p>

                                                        <p>5. If, in any calendar year, eligible purchases on your Delta SkyMiles Gold Card account total $10,000 or more, you will receive a $100 Delta eCredit (the “Credit”) that can be used toward a Delta flight purchase. A Delta flight purchase is limited to purchases of Delta-marketed flights made on <a style="color: #4470c3; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.delta.com/">delta.com</a> or with Delta Reservations. The Credit may be applied toward the Delta airfare portion of a Delta Vacations package. The Credit is only valid for payment of tickets, including fare, surcharge and government-imposed taxes and fees imposed on the air transportation. It is not valid for other types of fees (including bag fees, change fees, upgrades or other ancillary purchases or fees with Delta), and it does not have any cash value. The Credit expires within one year from the date of issuance and must be redeemed on or before the expiration date. If the value of the Credit is greater than the flight purchased, the Card Member will be able to use the residual value in another transaction before the expiration date. The Credit will be issued as a Delta eCredit, which will be available in your Delta Wallet when you are logged into your SkyMiles account on <a style="color: #4470c3; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.delta.com/">delta.com</a>. Visit <a style="color: #4470c3; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.delta.com/edocs/redeem-documents">delta.com/redeem</a> for more information about redemption options. The certificate number, a redemption code, and redemption instructions will also be sent to the email address listed on your Delta SkyMiles account. Limit one Credit per calendar year. Please allow up to 2 weeks after meeting the purchase requirement for the Credit to be issued. The Credit is non-transferable from one Member's account to another but can be applied towards someone else's ticket without limitation. The Credit may be combined with up to 2 other Delta eCredits. If you transfer from a different Delta SkyMiles Card product to the Delta SkyMiles Gold Card, any eligible purchases you made on your old Card during the calendar year will count toward the new Delta SkyMiles Gold Card purchase requirement, after you make your first transaction on the new Card. The Credit may be redeemed for Delta flights purchased in currencies other than United States Dollars and will be converted to the currency of the country of payment at the Bankers Rate of Exchange in effect on the date of ticket issuance, and the rate of exchange must be indicated on the ticket. The benefit is only available to the Basic Card Member; however, eligible purchases made by Additional Card Members will contribute to the purchase requirement. Eligible purchases are purchases for goods and services minus returns and other credits. Eligible purchases do NOT include fees or interest charges, balance transfers, cash advances, purchases of traveler’s checks, purchases of gift cards, person-to-person transactions, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents.  Eligible purchases may fall outside of the calendar year in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped. Additional terms, conditions and restrictions apply.
